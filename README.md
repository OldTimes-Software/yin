Yin is a 3D game engine, being developed by 
[Mark "hogsy" Sowden](https://hogsy.me/), 
for game jams and prototyping.

**It is not currently ready for production use!** 
And is available here with absolutely no support whatsoever. 
You're welcome to email me for help, just don't expect any.

The philosophy behind this engine would probably be considered
[NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here),
as the engine avoids many third-party libraries to ensure a lightweight 
design (despite not necessarily being the more optimal approach).

But *why*? 
It's a bit much for me to get into in a readme, but I've provided a few points below.

- It's educational! And _sometimes_ fun!
- It _hopefully_ encourages innovation
- Lightweight design ensures components of the engine can be radically shifted or redesigned to suit your needs
- With direct control over every component of the software, we're not at the mercy of someone else

That all being said, **Yin is not recommended for use in your own projects**, 
as this is not intended as a professional grade engine but instead just 
something that's easy to throw things at and modify. It's also worth
adding that it's being developed primarily for **fun**, hence why you're not necessarily
going to receive any support from me.

## Games

Below is a list of released games that have used this engine.
