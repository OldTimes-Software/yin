# Dickens Scripting Language

Well, here it is, my first scripting language...
Yeah, it's awful! But this has been something I've wanted to try my hand
at for a long time and Yin needed an intermediate language (in my opinion).

For now this is totally interpreted. The next version will actually provide
a virtual machine and other fun crap, but this was heckish enough already
that I'd decided to leave that out for now (though you can see some rumblings
towards the VM side of things.)

## Project Layout

- *dcmd* is a command line utility for using the scripting language
- *lib* is the library itself compiled as a dll
- *tests* samples and other crap
