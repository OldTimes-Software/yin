WIND PARTICLE SYSTEM
    We could probably simulate wind in a more interesting
    way by piping particles in at a particular direction
    into the level, and then bouncing them off surfaces.

    Particle stores direction it's travelling and speed.

    Each particle can have a given radius, anything caught
    in that radius will have the properties of that particle
    applied to it.
