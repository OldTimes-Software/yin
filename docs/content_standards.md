# Yin Content Standards

## Naming

For any files of the following node object types, please use the following extension.
Any legacy documents might use `node` or `world.n` - these should be updated to the standard conventions as well.

| Object Type      | Extension |
|------------------|-----------|
| `config`         | `.cfg.n`  |
| `entityTemplate` | `.ent.n`  |
| `effect`         | `.eff.n`  |
| `material`       | `.mat.n`  |
| `model`          | `.mdl.n`  |
| `world`          | `.wld.n`  |
| `worldMesh`      | `.wsm.n`  |

Any binary forms should use the same convention going forward.
To avoid any conflicts, these should ideally be generated into an alternate root location.

## Textures

Yin has support for a large range of different formats, that said we would recommend using industry standard formats
such as the following.

- PNG
- TGA
- DDS
- GFX
